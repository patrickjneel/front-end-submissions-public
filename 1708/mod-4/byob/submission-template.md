# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/Cache123/byob-electric-vh/blob/b086d9038756ff3dcf9a18a4abe650c039892ebf/server.js#L26)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
This was the JWT part, which I was still unclear about after our lesson, but Sam did this part and explained it to me and I feel better about using JWT and implementing them.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/Cache123/byob-electric-vh/blob/b086d9038756ff3dcf9a18a4abe650c039892ebf/server.js#L214)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
Our deleting of the companies was a bit tough, because it was still linked to a table and coudn't be deleted without messing up the other table. It was a bit of trickery.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

Anything else you wanna say

This was a tough project, but it made me feel better about building a server file, and although are tables aren't terribly complicated it was still nice to get come good practice.
